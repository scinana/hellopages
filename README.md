# hellopages

* This is the **readme.md** which is rendered as the "homepage" when opening my repo on Github

* This repo will be used as a test for my hellopages page    <br/> <br/>

**Theme for Github Pages:**  
* I have added the Cayman theme as per the instructions at (need to add link)  
* Now that im using a theme, it will update all the metadata (md) files but will not update the html files, (taken from [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser#:~:text=Under%20your%20repository%20name%2C%20click,your%20site's%20README.md%20file.))


**Modifying the layout of my Github Page**  
I have followed the instructions in this [tutorial](https://aregsar.com/blog/2019/how-to-customize-your-github-pages-blog-layout-in-five-minutes/)  
1. I have copied the raw HTML from the Cayman's theme default.html file (file found [here](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/blob/master/_layouts/default.html))  
2. I have added this to my own _layouts/default.html file --> this file will override the one from the theme  
3. If I want to modify any HTML/CSS I can do it in my repo directly, by altering my own version of the default.html file  

**Attribution:**  
I am using the Cayman theme and I have also copied the [default.html file from the Cayman theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) and pasted it into my own repo. From here I will make changes to the default.html file ON MY REPO ONLY.
